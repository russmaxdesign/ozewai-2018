We have a great list of speakers lined up for the OZeWAI Conference 2018. Our feature speakers this week are:

Dr Scott Hollier

Dr Scott Hollier specialises in the field of digital accessibility and is the author of the book ‘Outrunning the Night: a life journey of disability, determination and joy’. With a Ph.D. in Internet Studies and project management experience across the not-for-profit, corporate and government sectors, Scott is an internationally-recognised researcher and speaker. Consultancy areas include consumer-based support for service organisations, developer-based support for ICT professionals for web and app-related work and support across different organisational roles to achieve compliance with digital accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0. Services include direct consultancy, project management, accessibility training and resource development. Scott also lectures at Edith Cowan University and the University of South Australia in the areas of information management and web accessibility.

Andrew Downie

Andrew Downie is a psychologist with a post-graduate diploma in education. He appreciates the benefits that both mainstream and specialised technology offer. He is not, however, a fan of gadgets for their own sake - equipment should be useful rather than gimmicky. An issue that Andrew is passionate about is the potential benefit to people who have disabilities by the effective use of technology.
