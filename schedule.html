        <h4>Here comes 2.1!</h4>
<p><a href="speakers.php#amanda-mace">Amanda Mace</a> and <a href="speakers.php#julie-grundy">Julie Grundy</a></p>
<p>WCAG 2.1 is here and we’re all thrilled to finally have some new Success Criteria (SC) to play with! The W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG) released 17 new SC in June of this year. But what techniques should we be recommending to our clients? What about your own website? Amanda Mace is a member of the AGWG and Julie Grundy makes accessible websites, and we’ve paired up to show you useful techniques on a demonstration website. We’re including code examples all available for you to copy and change to suit your needs. WCAG 2.1 is the future for Digital Accessibility and we’ll show you how it can work for you and your clients!</p>
<h4>WCAG 2.1 for designers</h4>
<p><a href="speakers.php#andrew-arch">Andrew Arch</a></p>
<p>Many of the new WCAG 2.1 criteria have implications for designers: graphics, content and UX. Andrew will discuss relevant criteria from a design perspective and identify who needs to take responsibility for what.</p>
<h4>Goodbye traditional CAPTCHA: new W3C advice to tell humans and robots apart</h4>
<p><a href="speakers.php#scott-hollier">Dr Scott Hollier</a></p>
<p>The traditional CAPTCHA, the representation of text in a bitmapped image, has been a well-established process for trying to protect websites from robots and scripts for many years. However, these CAPTCHA processes not only separate humans from robots, but tend to put people with disabilities in the ‘robot’ category. This presentation will discuss recent work by the W3C Research Questions Task Force to provide updated advice on more accessible solutions.</p>

<p>With the population ageing and services being increasingly digital, it’s time we took a selfish view of accessibility and looked after our older relatives and our future selves. Andrew will discuss the common ageing impairments and disabilities and what aspects of WCAG particularly apply.</p>
<h4>Manual and Automated Comprehensive Testing</h4>
<p><a href="speakers.php#ian-laslett">Ian Laslett</a></p>
<p>When your website can span from hundreds to thousands of pages and considering that there are different WCAG 2.0 success criteria (62 that is!), your team possibly does a lot of code check. Automated tests are essential when developing or maintaining a website and of course identifying errors on a technical level. But, as the saying goes, “Robots will not take over the world”. There are many accessibility criteria successes that still requires the human touch. A lot of it. It is essential for a compliant website to have a good balance of manual and automated testing.</p>

A presentation of how Australian government website design and communications teams are managing the conversion of content that are in PDF format to HTML and other alternatives in a bid to make them more accessible, and the successes and challenges along the way.</p>
<h4>Rise of inclusive publishing</h4>
<p><a href="speakers.php#gren-alchin">Greg Alchin</a></p>
<p>The Australasian publishing industry is going through an inclusion innovation. There are many factors driving this change. The merger of the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) into the W3C, rise of EPUB as the dominant publishing format, proliferation of EPUB reading systems, the impact of international mandates (Marrakesh Treaty) and new government procurement standards (AS EN 301:549) are all key factors driving the change. Out of this change has risen the Australian Inclusive Publishing Initiative (AIPI). The AIPI includes representatives of the publishing industry, authors, agents, editors, designers, libraries, copyright organisations, disability associations, government and accessible format providers. The aim of AIPI is to ensure all digital publications are barrier free and inclusive by design by no later than December 2021. Building publisher capacity is one of the key goals. in the process moving to EPUB as its default digital format. For readers with a print a disability this is welcome news. For web accessibility specialists it is an opportunity to transfer their technical knowledge and apply it to this format. Understanding the technical issues is only part of the equation. Unpacking and understanding how all the factors fit together is essential to ensuring success.</p>

<p>Everyone is different. Some of us are characterised as having a disability. Most of us in this category are different. What matters to us is our immediate requirements, not those of anyone else or us at another time. Today’s technology allows for incredible personalisation - can our requirements be met on an individual basis? So we get what we actually need? Every institution is different. Broadcasters and educational institutions and associations and services all have different audiences and, within them, many different people. Different institutions need to provide services and contents to their audience in ways that are appropriate for them.</p>
<p>Today’s technology allows for analysis of our audience, and for specialised delivery of services and content.So there it is: being inclusive is never the same - for those being inclusive or for those being included. Extensive research over the last 30 years has shown what sort of difficulties people can have and thus the potential range of their requirements. OZeWAI wants to engage and make explicit the expertise of its community for the development of an ‘inclusive framework’ or ‘roadmap’ that shows providers and consumers how to tackle the problem of inclusion. There is already a plethora of solutions once an organisation has identified its particular range of needs, and OZeWAI experts can point others to the many sources of relevant information, guidelines and regulations. OZeWAI needs to do this remembering the variety of potential approaches to being inclusive:    </p>
